# Promoting Electric Vehicle Adoption to Combat Climate Change in Melbourne

## Introduction

This document serves as an essential guide for the iteration analysis and design of our project, **"Promoting Electric Vehicle Adoption to Combat Climate Change in Melbourne."** It outlines the projectâ€™s objectives, target audience, and current iteration plans.

## Project Overview

### Project Description

The project aims to develop a comprehensive and user-centric solution for promoting electric vehicle (EV) adoption in Melbourne. The main problem being addressed is the low adoption rate of electric vehicles in Melbourne, largely due to concerns over high costs, limited charging infrastructure, and lack of reliable information.

### Problem Statement

As Melbourne faces escalating climate challenges and a surge in environmental consciousness, there is a pressing need to address transportation emissions. Electric vehicles (EVs) offer a significant opportunity to lower greenhouse gas emissions and enhance environmental sustainability.

Despite their benefits, EV adoption in Australia is limited, with only **3.8% of new cars sold being electric**, compared to the **global average of 9%**. Frequent commuters who travel from suburban areas to the city and vice-versa are becoming more conscious of their carbon footprint and the advantages of EVs. However, they are deterred by concerns over high costs and inadequate charging infrastructure.

> **How can we overcome these barriers and encourage these commuters to transition to electric vehicles, thereby supporting a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and fostering a more sustainable future?**

## Target Audience

Our intended audience consists of **frequent commuters in Melbourne**, particularly those who travel from suburban areas to the city. These audiences have the most potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by switching to electric vehicles.
